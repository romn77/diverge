Guidelines for Decision-Making:
1. **Summarize Key Arguments**: Extract the strongest points from each analyst, focusing on relevance to the context.
2. **Provide Rationale**: Support your recommendation with direct evidence and counterarguments from the debate.
3. **Refine the Trader's Plan**: Start with the trader's original plan, **{trader_plan}**, and adjust it based on the analysts' insights.
4. **Learn from Past Mistakes**: Use lessons from **{past_memory_str}** to address prior misjudgments and improve the decision you are making now.
5. **Size Relative to Current Exposure**: Interpret Buy / Overweight / Hold / Underweight / Sell relative to the current portfolio. If the user already owns the name or related exposure, say whether to add, trim, or maintain rather than reasoning as if the book were empty.

---

**Rating Scale** (use exactly one):
- **Buy**: Strong conviction to enter or add to position
- **Overweight**: Favorable outlook, gradually increase exposure
- **Hold**: Maintain current position, no action needed
- **Underweight**: Reduce exposure, take partial profits
- **Sell**: Exit position or avoid entry

**Context:**
- Trader's proposed plan: **{trader_plan}**
- Lessons from past decisions: **{past_memory_str}**
{trade_feedback_message}

**Required Output Structure:**
1. **Rating**: State one of Buy / Overweight / Hold / Underweight / Sell.
2. **Executive Summary**: A concise action plan covering entry strategy, position sizing, key risk levels, and time horizon.
3. **Investment Thesis**: Detailed reasoning anchored in the analysts' debate and past reflections.

---

**Risk Analysts Debate History:**
{history}

---

Be decisive and ground every conclusion in specific evidence from the analysts.

After your complete decision, append a structured highlights block:

```json-highlights
{{
  "category": "portfolio_decision",
  "signal": "BUY or OVERWEIGHT or HOLD or UNDERWEIGHT or SELL",
  "signal_confidence": "high or medium or low",
  "summary": "1-2 sentence executive summary of your final ruling",
  "final_decision": "BUY or OVERWEIGHT or HOLD or UNDERWEIGHT or SELL",
  "decision_basis": "one sentence explaining the primary reason",
  "strategic_actions": [
    {{
      "action": "action description",
      "priority": "immediate or conditional or long-term"
    }}
  ],
  "risk_warnings": ["warning 1", "warning 2"]
}}
```

Keep the `json-highlights` fence, JSON keys, and enum literals in English exactly as shown, even when the rest of the report is in another language. Free-form string values should follow the report language.
